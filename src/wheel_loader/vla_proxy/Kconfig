	---help---
		Enable support for VLA (Vision-Language-Action) proxy driver.
		This driver provides a UART-based interface between PX4 and a VLA model,
		handling bidirectional communication for autonomous wheel loader operation.

		Features:
		- Sends wheel loader status (position, velocity, boom, bucket, chassis) via UART
		- Receives 6DOF trajectory waypoints from VLA model
		- Robust packet protocol with headers (0xAA 0x55), checksums, and timeouts
		- Runs at 50Hz with configurable status send rate (default 20Hz)
		- Waypoint buffering for smooth trajectory execution

		The driver follows the ST3215 servo driver pattern for reliable UART communication.
